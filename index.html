    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>As a strong believer of emphatic approach, my strengths are in user-centered design and analytic working methods. I bring value to people's everyday lives by understandable and effortless, accessible design. <br>
        <br>
        I'm driven, outgoing and hard-working individual with growing expertise in user experience. I'm working towards a future-proof career in the world of digital services. With industry needs in mind, I’m currently studying coding to become the UX expert and a competent colleague to developers and other stakeholders. <br>
        <br>
        Being a forever-curious soul, I've built a strong UX skillset including qualitative and quantitative research methods, facilitating user testing and building both low and high fidelity prototypes in appropriate parts of the design process. I've adopted agile teamwork methodologies such as Scrum as part of my workflow. I master Figma and Adobe CC and I’m no stranger to design systems, microcopy and AI tools. <br>
        <br>
        In my previous life I’ve been called a fast learning, innovative team player. I naturally consider different stakeholder’s viewpoints and I’m also able to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. With a great team collaborative problem solving is often innovative problem solving. <br>
        <br>
        My background with service design, industrial and product design, management, marketing and customer service has built a wide-ranging foundation for my career as an user experience expert.br<br>
        <br>
        I’m a strong advocate for equality and human rights and I stand for a diverse and inclusive community. <br>
